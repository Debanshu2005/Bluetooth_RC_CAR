## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Bluetooth Control:**  
   The ESP32 connects to a smartphone via Bluetooth. A mobile app (such as *Arduino Bluetooth controller* from the Play Store) sends commands like **Forward**, **Backward**, **Left**, **Right**, and **Stop**.

2. **Signal Processing:**  
   The ESP32 receives these commands through its Bluetooth serial interface and decodes them in real-time.

3. **Motor Driving:**  
   - Two **BTS7960 drivers** handle the 4 motors (2 per driver).  
   - Each driver receives PWM signals from the ESP32 to control the direction and speed of the motors.

4. **Movement:**  
   - **Forward:** All motors rotate forward.  
   - **Backward:** All motors rotate backward.  
   - **Left / Right:** One side slows down or reverses to turn.  
   - **Stop:** PWM signals are set to 0.

## üîå Circuit Overview

**ESP32 Connections:**
- Each BTS7960 is connected to separate PWM and enable pins from the ESP32.
- logic power (5V) are derived from the expansion board.
- The 9V battery powers both motor drivers and ESP32 via the barrel jack of the expansion board.

**Basic Wiring Flow:**
- ESP32 ‚Üí BTS7960 #1 ‚Üí [Front Left + Front Right Motors]
- ESP32 ‚Üí BTS7960 #2 ‚Üí [Rear Left + Rear Right Motors]
- Battery ‚Üí ESP32 Expansion Board (barrel jack)
- LiPo ‚Üí BTS7960 #1and BTS7960 #2 (To power the motors)

## üì± Mobile App Control

You can use any **Bluetooth Controller App**

**Typical Control Buttons:**
- üîº Forward  
- üîΩ Backward  
- ‚óÄÔ∏è Left  
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Right  
    

Pair the ESP32 via Bluetooth (device name will appear as *ESP32_BT* or similar) and start controlling your car.
